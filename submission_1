Currently the website is not working.

Due to time constrains, I just put the google map on it and d3.

I will continue to implement it by importing the data from data.gov and some data from purdue police department.

You could run the application by first do a npm install and bower install to get all the dependencies and then run grunt serve to run the server.

Unit test cases are not written yet.
